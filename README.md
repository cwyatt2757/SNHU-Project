**Summary**

Project three required developing software for a grocery store named Corner Grocer and they wanted a way to identify how often an item is purchased from their produce section. The issue the store had was that the current purchase system logged only single entries for each item, this could cause a ton of extra work due to the duplicates of multiple items every day. The software I created elimites duplicates and grants unique entries for these items and the purchase frequencies. A file is exported with a timestamp to prevent overwrites and adding historical reference.

**Achievements**

With the end-user experience in mind it gave inonovative ideas on what would be needed to make this plan happen. Using C++ map to create keys based on item names and assin class objects with values is what really pivoted me forward. There were many failed attempts but my tenacity for my envision programed kept me going which resulted in new concepts learned and many approaches to completing what was required.

**Enhancement**

I believe I could have been more familiar with C++ to learn new ways to save lines of code to impliment my idea easier. With more expertise, I will be able to revisit this code and make it alot shorter and effective as a program. 

**Challenges**

I suffered alot of struggle with this project starting out as a novice programmer; the first being creating dynamic objects. Inserting classes manually is something im more familiar with, but doing a so dynamically was its own challenge for me. A second challenge I faced was properly using inputs that had duplicates and returning an output that was free of any duplicates. 

**Support**

This assignment gave me more experience using C++ which helps me understand whats going on in higher levels of code, along with the valueable resources provided by my professor throughout the course.

**Skils**

This was the first class that felt relatable to a real-world scenario where I would be using my programming skills and that itself is extremely valueable. This course and project shows me how my future career will look moving forward and changed my perspective on what is required of me moving forward in my classes and career.

**Future proof**

When creating the code I focused on industry standards which includes comments on line making it easy to understand what was in my mind for others when I crafted this program. The use of an alias for the map helped simplify the arguments of functions so they were less cluttered looking which took a bit of load off my mind reading the full map definition every time. With a few changes this code can be made accessible for many others to use.
